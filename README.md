# USCG Oil Spill Response Documents

This repository contains [documents](docs/) related to __oil spill responses__ coordinated by the US Coast Guard (USCG). The documents are being [provided](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/documents/uscg-oil-spill-response-costs/) on a rolling basis by USCG to the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/), in response to [a Freedom of Information Act request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/oil-spill-response-costs/). 

## Records Provided

The documents can be found in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory, which currently contains the following file(s):

- [`NPFC_CM_00339_Release_01_Redacted.pdf`](docs/NPFC_CM_00339_Release_01_Redacted.pdf)
    - 150 pages
    - Includes documents for these Federal Project Numbers: `UCGPG23001`, `UCGPJ23004`, `UCGPN23007`, `UCGPP23002`.

These files are provided exactly as USCG provided them to the Data Liberation Project. USCG's FOIA office says that they will continue to provide documents on a rolling basis, 150 pages at a time.
